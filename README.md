# ðŸŸ© commit-graph-art

> âœ¨ A creative experiment to generate custom patterns on the GitHub contribution graph using Git, Node.js, and a bit of automation.

---

## ðŸŽ¨ What is this?

This project uses scripts to generate realistic Git commits on specific dates to "draw" shapes and patterns on the GitHub contribution calendar. Think of it as terminal-based pixel art made of commits.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Custom commit patterns (random, dense, letters, symbols)
- Realistic commit timestamps (1â€“10 per day)
- Uses Node.js, `simple-git`, `moment`, and `random`
- Can run locally and generate commits across 7â€“12 months
- Good for learning Git automation and scripting
